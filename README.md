# Docker Local Development Environments

## About

I wanted to create a simple development environment that I could fork to quickly  
get started on a Python (or another) project.  By using Docker Compose it allowed me to create
multi-container applications using different technologies and stitch them together.
For script development it gives me the ability to create a container with all the software I need
and I can create a new environment for different scripts if needed.

## Origin

This project is inspired by, and forked from, this blog post:

**üê≥ Simplified guide to using Docker for local development environment**

## Running

To run the example:

- `git clone https://github.com/briandoconnor/blog-docker-dev-environment-example.git`
- `docker-compose up`

Details about each service and how to run them is present in the individual services directories.

## My Modifications

I'm leaving the go and node services in place but turning them off in the
docker-compose.yml file.  The old docker-compose is preserved here.

I've reorganized the services into the `services` directory and the
working directory is mounted and shared across the docker containers when run.

## Basic Python Script

I have a basic script located in `working/scripts/basic_python_script/process.py`
that shows how to use argparse and json, items that I routinely need to use in
simple scripts.
